   <h1>Duality</h1>
   <h2>Slipknot</h2>

   <p>I push my fingers into my eyes <br>
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <br>
But it's made of all the things I have to take <br>
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <br>
If the pain goes on, oh <br>
<br>
I have screamed until my veins collapsed <br>
I waited as my time's elapsed <br>
Now all I do is live with so much fate <br>
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that <br>
I've left behind this little fact <br>
You cannot kill what you did not create <br>
<br>
I've gotta say what I've gotta say <br>
And then I swear I'll go away <br>
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise <br>
I guess I'll save the best for last <br>
My future seems like one big past <br>
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice <br>
<br>
I push my fingers into my eyes <br>
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <br>
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it <br>
<br>
Put me back together or separate the skin from bone <br>
Leave me all the pieces <br>
Then you can leave me alone <br>
Tell me the reality is better than the dream <br>
But I found out the hard way <br>
Nothing is what it seems! <br>
<br>
I push my fingers into my eyes <br>
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <br>
But it's made of all the things I have to take <br>
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <br>
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it <br>
<br>
All I've got <br>
All I've got is insane <br>
All I've got <br>
All I've got is insane <br>
<br>
All I've got <br>
All I've got is insane <br>
All I've got <br>
All I've got is insane <br>
<br>
All I've got <br>
All I've got is insane <br>
All I've got <br>
All I've got is insane <br>
<br>
I push my fingers into my eyes <br>
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <br>
But it's made of all the things I have to take <br>
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <br>
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it <br>
<br>
All I've got <br>
All I've got is insane <br>
All I've got <br>
All I've got is insane <br>
<br>
All I've got <br>
All I've got is insane <br>
All I've got <br>
All I've got is insane</p>
